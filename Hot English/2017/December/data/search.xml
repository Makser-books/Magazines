a cognate n

several languages. For example, “garden” 
(English), “jardin” (French) and "jardín" 
(Spanish) are all cognates
an anchor word n 
a word that helps you remember another 
word because it’s associated with this 
target word. When you see or hear the

a target word n 
the word you’re trying to learn or 
remember. Literally, a “target” is something 
you try to hit with a knife, gun, arrow, etc.
6 TOP TIPS FOR LEARNING   
DIFFICULT WORDS! 
Words are really important when you’re learning a language. You need them to speak, write and understand 
things. And the more words you know, the easier it is for you. Even if your grammar is perfect, if you don’t 
know many words, you’ll find it hard to speak fluently. But not all words are the same. 
Some are easy to understand because they’re similar in your language  
or they remind you of something you already know. For example, “education” 
is a cognate in many languages (“educación” in Spanish, and “education” 
in French). 
But other words aren’t so easy. Take the example of “squirrel” – a small 
animal with a long furry tail. The word is probably like nothing you’ve seen 
in your own language. So, what can you do to help you remember it and other 
equally difficult words? Here are 6 top tips for learning difficult words.

So, what can you do to improve your pronunciation?   The next thing you need to do is to learn how to read 
The most important thing to understand is that English is  phonetic script. This is extremely useful. There are 26 letters

recording afterwards, you can compare your pronunciation 
with the master version.
Finally, try this useful exercise for really improving your 
pronunciation. Get a recording (about 10 minutes long) of 
someone speaking in English. Listen to it a few times to get 
familiar with it. Then, start listening intensively to it. Go back 
to the beginning and take a deep breath. Then, play the frst 
sentence from the recording. As you listen, say the sentence 
out loud at the same time as the recording. Don’t repeat the 
sentence after the recording – do it with the speaker, copying 
their intonation, pronunciation and stress patterns. Do it 
several times (twenty is not too many). Then, move on to the 
next sentence. Keep going till you get to the end. And then 
start the whole process again until you can do it all by heart. 
Good luck, and remember, comprehensibility is the aim of the 
game. Go for it!
