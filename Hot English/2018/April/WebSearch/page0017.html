GLOSSARYa cognate n  TRACK 08: ENGLISHMENa word that has the same origin or root in several languages. For example, “garden” (English), “jardin” (French) and "jardín" (Spanish) are all cognatesan anchor word n a word that helps you remember another word because it’s associated with this target word. When you see or hear the anchor word, you think of your target worda target word n the word you’re trying to learn or remember.

You need them to speak, write and understand things. And the more words you know, the easier it is for you. Even if your grammar is perfect, if you don’t know many words, you’ll find it hard to speak fluently. But not all words are the same. Some are easy to understand because they’re similar in your language  or they remind you of something you already know. For example, “education” is a cognate in many languages (“educación” in Spanish, and “education” in French). But other words aren’t so easy. Take the example of “squirrel” – a small animal with a long furry tail. The word is probably like nothing you’ve seen in your own language. So, what can you do to help you remember it and other equally difficult words?

For example, imagine sound a small animal makes. This will be your “anchor  you wanted to learn the word “endorse”, which means word” – the word that will help you remember the target  to support or approve something. One word that rhymes word (squirrel, in this case). Next, you need to create a  with “endorse” is “horse”. So, now all you need to do is to sentence with both these terms. However, try to make the  create a funny sentence with both words, and add a picture sentence a bit funny, unusual or crazy. In fact, the funnier  of it to really help you remember it. For example:  or crazier it is the easier it’ll be to remember. For example:  “THE HORSE ENDORSED THEIR DECISION TO GO BY CART.”  “THE SQUIRREL SQUEAKED WHEN HE SAW THAT SOMEONE HAD STOLEN HIS SNACK.”2IMAGES    Next, create an image for your sentence. A sentence plus an image will really help you remember the word. For added effect, the image should be colourful and a bit crazy. Our brains are specially designed This is a to catch and understand visual good idea!squeakinformation quickly – and your brain will remember a funny, colourful picture much more easily. “THE SQUIRREL SQUEAKED WHEN HE SAW THAT SOMEONE HAD STOLEN  HIS SNACK.”/    www.learnhotenglish.com / For Skype / Telephone speaking classes, e-mail classes@learnhotenglish.com18
