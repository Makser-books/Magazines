When you listen to the recording afterwards, you can compare your pronunciation with the master version.Finally, try this useful exercise for really improving your pronunciation. Get a recording (about 10 minutes long) of someone speaking in English. Listen to it a few times to get familiar with it. Then, start listening intensively to it. Go back to the beginning and take a deep breath. Then, play the frst sentence from the recording. As you listen, say the sentence out loud at the same time as the recording. Don’t repeat the sentence after the recording – do it with the speaker, copying their intonation, pronunciation and stress patterns. Do it several times (twenty is not too many). Then, move on to the next sentence. Keep going till you get to the end. And then start the whole process again until you can do it all by heart. Good luck, and remember, comprehensibility is the aim of the game. Go for it! /    www.learnhotenglish.com / Want to do an internship with Hot English?
